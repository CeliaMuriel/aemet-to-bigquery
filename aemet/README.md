When you are ready to get the meteorological information, you can execute the aemet.sh.

You can schedule the execution of the aemet.sh script daily.

The API Key needed to download data from the AEMET is hardcoded in aemet.sh. This is NOT a good practice for Production. Secure this Key as per your organizationâ€™s security standard and policy.

Additionally, set [PROJECT ID] to your actual project ID in the scripts.
